## Hi there, I'm Chia 🌿👋
(Yes, just like chia seeds!)

I’m a passionate **Data Scientist** who loves turning data into stories and insights. I specialize in making data tell its secrets with a blend of code, visualization, and modeling. I work at the intersection of data and product, using analytics to shape better decisions, features, and data products.


### Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Looker Studio, Tableau, Datawrapper, Excel
- **Databases:** MySQL, Snowflake, MongoDB, Neo4j, MS Access
- **Other:** ETL, A/B Testing, Data Modeling

### Data and Analytics Projects

- **[Business Analytics Scenarios](https://github.com/chia-chang/business-analytics-scenarios)** | SQL  
  Ad-hoc **SQL** analyses for 5 realistic business scenarios using a 100K+ order e-commerce dataset. Includes seller performance audits, late delivery investigation, campaign ROI measurement, and customer value.  
  

- **[COVID Analytics Automation](https://github.com/chia-chang/covid-analytics-automation)** | Python  
  Recreated my work from IBM where I automated COVID-19 reporting. Built a pipeline that handles data cleaning, validation, and KPI calculations (7-day moving averages, test positivity, trends). Cut reporting time by 80% (3-4 hours → 15 minutes) in production.  
  
### Product Case Studies
See how I approach the same projects from a product and stakeholder perspective.  
Case studies written from a product point of view:
